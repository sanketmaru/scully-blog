excerpt: The great aim of knowledge of education is not knowledge but action

**Only knowledge that is used sticks in your minds.** 

We solve issues daily and mostly 99% of the time if we google we do get the solutions. Then there is 1% left
where we find a real solution to our problem. 

This blog posts have been drafted for long time , and now its time for action. 
I will cover as many scenarios we face daily and solutions we solve not only for us but also while helping others. 

I work more closely with the Angular World as thats the framework used in the organization i work. 
I do keep an eye on other libraries such as React, Vue and learn them through some POC projects. 
The best way to learn something and be updated is to experience them.
